<h3><b>jQuery History</b></h3>

jQuery established by John Resig in August 2006. Initially, It's created to simplify JavaScript programming and providing a more easy and consistent way for interacting with HTML documents.

At the releasing time, JavaScript development was a challenge due to it's inconsistencies and incompatibilities in browser. jQuery aimed to solve these problems by providing unified API that abstracted away the JavaScript's complexities and offered a simplified syntax for common tasks.
