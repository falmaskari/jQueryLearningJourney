## 📅 jQuery History

jQuery established by John Resig in August 2006. 🌟 Initially, It's created to simplify JavaScript programming and providing a more easy and consistent way for interacting with HTML documents.

🌐 At the releasing time, JavaScript development was a challenge due to it's inconsistencies and incompatibilities in browser. 😕 jQuery aimed to solve these problems by providing unified API that abstracted away the JavaScript's complexities and offered a simplified syntax for common tasks. 🚀

💡 jQuery gained popularity among web developers quickly due to it's powerful and intuitive way for working with HTML, manipulating the DOM, handling events, performing animations, and simplifing AJAX requests. It helped bridge the gaps between various browsers and made web development more accessible. ✨

🔗 <b>AJAX:</b> Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) is a technique which is used for sending and receiving data from a server without refresh the entire page. jQuery simplifies AJAX requests via providing methods for performing HTTP requests, handling responses, and updating page content dynamically.
